As far as jobs go, at this point I'd settle for anything just to get my foot in the door! But from an idealistic point of view I think a small company would be good for me. Getting to know all of my fellow devs and other employees on a first name basis and having a close knit team would be ideal for me. A feeling of comfortability within the workplace is extremely important. Working for a big company would of course still be great, but this is just what I feel I would be most suited for.
